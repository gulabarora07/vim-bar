# Pun Intended
A Soap for cleaning code.
# Features
* A .vimrc/init.vim which contains a single line of code
* Handles both `vim` and `NeoVim`
* [Vim-Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) plugin manager for asynchronus plugins in NeoVim
* Many Key bindings I love
* Boilerplate code insertion for certain types of files
* All the plugins I use
* Auto commands for certain files
# Installation
It's suggested you view bar.vim and all the other dependency files in the vimbar folder rather than just using this as is  
But for instant comfort,
```
git clone https://github.com/yashsriv/vim-bar.git ~/.vim
```
